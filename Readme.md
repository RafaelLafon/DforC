## Branching Strategy
**Masterful/Mainline Branch**: Maintain the master or main branch in a deployable state, embodying stability and production readiness.
**Feature Symphony**: Cultivate distinct branches for individual features or bug fixes, employing evocative titles to avert potential conflicts.
**Merge conflict**: please ask github's manager project when you want merge a branch, to avoid as many worries as possible

## Syntax & layout 
**File**: For every file's name please use camelCase style to display a common style.
**Directory**: For every directory's name please use maj at first char.

## Security and Permissions
**Team Project**: Curtail repository access to authorized contributors. Administer permissions judiciously to accommodate your team's diverse roles.

**Dependency Vigilance**: Periodically assess and rejuvenate dependencies, precluding potential security vulnerabilities from seeping into your project.

**Note:** Please, don't use ChatGPT too much; favor [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)-type sites.
